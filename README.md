# Author-s-Gender-Prediction-Based-on-Their-Bangla-Text
This is our thesis topic. This study investigates predicting the gender of Bangla authors using a unique approach: analyzing the relative frequency of Bangla pronouns in their writings. We use machine learning algorithms and explore different word segment lengths (ranging from 2000 to 4000 words) to uncover subtle patterns that help determine gender without delving into author profiling. Our research contributes to the understanding of gender prediction within Bangla authorship, establishing a foundation for further exploration and underscoring the potential for innovative applications. By comparing our findings with previous research, we bridge the gap between linguistic analysis and gender prediction, adding depth to the intricate relationship between language and authorship in the context of Bangla literature.
